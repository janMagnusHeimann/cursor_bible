## 🎯 Best Practices

### Writing Effective Cursor Rules

1. **Be Specific**: Target exact frameworks and use cases
2. **Include Context**: Explain when and why to use each rule
3. **Provide Examples**: Show real-world applications
4. **Keep Updated**: Maintain rules as tools evolve
5. **Test Thoroughly**: Validate in actual development scenarios

### Using Rules Effectively

- Start with base templates and customize for your project
- Combine multiple rules for comprehensive coverage
- Regularly update rules as your codebase evolves
- Share feedback and improvements with the community
